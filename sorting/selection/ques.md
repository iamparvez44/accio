🔹 Selection Sort — Easy to Moderate

Write a program to sort an array of integers in ascending order using Selection Sort.

Modify your Selection Sort to sort in descending order.

Print the array after each selection step to show how the smallest element moves to the front.

Given an array, use Selection Sort to find the smallest k elements (without sorting the whole array).

Modify Selection Sort to work on an array of strings lexicographically.

Explain what happens if you swap inside the inner loop of Selection Sort instead of after it — and verify by coding it.

Find the number of swaps made by Selection Sort for an input array.

Write Selection Sort without using a temporary variable (try swapping using arithmetic or destructuring).

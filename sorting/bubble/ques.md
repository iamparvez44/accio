🟢 Basic Level

<!-- Sort an array in ascending order using Bubble Sort.
👉 Input: [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]
👉 Output: [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9] -->

<!-- Sort in descending order using Bubble Sort.
👉 Input: [3, 1, 4, 2]
👉 Output: [4, 3, 2, 1] -->

<!-- Count the number of swaps performed while sorting.
👉 Input: [4, 3, 2, 1]
👉 Output: 6 swaps -->

🟡 Intermediate Level

<!-- Stop early if the array becomes sorted before all passes complete (optimized bubble sort).
👉 Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
👉 Output: No swaps — array already sorted -->

Sort array of strings using Bubble Sort (lexicographical order).
👉 Input: ["banana", "apple", "cherry"]
👉 Output: ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

Sort array of objects by a property (like marks).
👉 Input:

[
  {name: "A", marks: 80},
  {name: "B", marks: 50},
  {name: "C", marks: 90}
]


👉 Output (sorted by marks ascending):
[{B, 50}, {A, 80}, {C, 90}]

🔵 Advanced / Conceptual

Find the Kth smallest element using Bubble Sort (no need to fully sort).
👉 Input: [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15], K = 3
👉 Output: 7

Sort only even numbers, keep odd numbers in their original position.
👉 Input: [5, 3, 2, 8, 1, 4]
👉 Output: [5, 3, 2, 4, 1, 8]

Sort an array but ignore negative numbers (they stay in place).
👉 Input: [5, -1, 3, 2, -7, 1]
👉 Output: [1, -1, 2, 3, -7, 5]

Implement Bubble Sort recursively (without loops).

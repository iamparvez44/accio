LEVEL 1 — BASICS (Concept Clarity Zone)

Focus: Definition, printing, counting, simple logic

Print all subarrays of an array.  done
👉 Input: [1, 2, 3]
👉 Output: [1] [1,2] [1,2,3] [2] [2,3] [3]
 
Count total number of subarrays of size n.  done
👉 (Use formula n*(n+1)/2)

Sum of all subarrays  done
👉 Input: [1, 2, 3] → Output: 20

Find maximum sum subarray (Kadane’s Algorithm) done
👉 Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4] → Output: 6  

Find minimum sum subarray

⚙️ LEVEL 2 — CONDITION-BASED QUESTIONS (Logic Building Zone) 

Focus: prefix sums, conditions, counting

Count subarrays with sum equal to K
👉 Input: [1,1,1], K=2 → Output: 2

Count subarrays with sum divisible by K
👉 Input: [4,5,0,-2,-3,1], K=5 → Output: 7

Find longest subarray with sum 0
👉 Input: [15, -2, 2, -8, 1, 7, 10, 23] → Output: 5

Find longest subarray with equal number of 0 and 1
👉 Input: [0,1,0,1,1,1,0]

Count subarrays with product less than K
👉 Input: [10, 5, 2, 6], K=100 → Output: 8
